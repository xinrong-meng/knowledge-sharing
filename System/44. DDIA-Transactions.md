# Transactions

A transaction is a way for an application to group several reads and writes together into a logical unit.
It is a valuable database feature, no matter which data model is used.

Conceptually, all the reads and writes in a transaction are executed as **one operation**: either the entire transaction 
succeeds (commit) or it fails (abort, rollback). If it fails, the application can safely retry.

Transactions are not a law of nature; they were created with a **purpose**, namely to **simplify** the programming 
model for **applications accessing a database**. By using transactions, the application is free to ignore certain 
potential error scenarios and concurrency issues, because the database takes care of them instead (we call these 
safety guarantees).

Here, we talk about transactions mostly in the context of a database running on a **single machine**. Transactions in 
distributed databases open a new set of difficult challenges, which we’ll discuss later.

Databases have long tried to hide concurrency issues from application developers by providing **transaction 
isolation**.

**Serializable isolation** means that the database guarantees that transactions have the same effect as if they ran 
serially (i.e., one at a time, without any concurrency). Serializable isolation has a performance cost, and many 
databases don’t want to pay that price. It’s therefore common for systems to use **weak(nonserializable) isolation**.

We will discuss several widely used isolation levels, in particular read committed, snapshot isolation (sometimes 
called repeatable read), and serializable.

As shown above, isolation levels are categorized by a set of race conditions handled. Some race conditions can be 
handled by database, whereas the others must be handled by applications accessing the database.

## Weak Isolation Levels

Weak isolation levels protect against some of anomalies but leave you, the application developer, to handle others 
manually (e.g., using explicit locking).

### Read Committed

**Two guarantees:**

- When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed (no dirty reads).

- When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed (no dirty writes). That is, the 
  issue as shown below cannot happen.

**Potential concurrency bug:** read skew. For example, Alice observes the database in an inconsistent state, as 
shown below.

### Snapshot Isolation (Repeatable Read)

Snapshot isolation(a.k.a repeatable read) is the most common solution to the read skew problem mentioned above.

The idea is that each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database—that is, the transaction sees all 
the data that was committed in the database at the start of the transaction. Even if the data is subsequently 
changed by another transaction, each transaction sees only the old data from that particular point in time.

## Serializable Isolation

Serializable isolation is usually regarded as the strongest isolation level. It guarantees that even though 
transactions may execute in parallel, the end result is the same as if they had executed one at a time, serially, 
without any concurrency. In other words, the database prevents all possible race conditions.

The following are example **implementations**.

### Actual Serial Execution

The simplest way of avoiding concurrency problems is to remove the concurrency entirely: to execute only one 
transaction at a time, in serial order, on a single thread.

A system designed for single-threaded execution can sometimes **perform** better than a system that supports 
concurrency, because it can avoid the coordination overhead of locking. However, its **throughput** is limited to 
that of a single CPU core.

### Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

Several transactions are allowed to concurrently read the same object as long as nobody is writing to it. But as 
soon as anyone wants to write (modify or delete) an object, exclusive access is required:

- If transaction A has read an object and transaction B wants to write to that object, B must wait until A commits or 
aborts before it can continue. (This ensures that B can’t change the object unexpectedly behind A’s back.)

- If transaction A has written an object and transaction B wants to read that object, B must wait until A commits or 
aborts before it can continue. (Reading an old version of the object.)

### Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)

It provides full serializability, but has only a small performance penalty compared to snapshot isolation.

It is an **optimistic** concurrency control technique. Optimistic in this context means that instead of blocking if 
something potentially dangerous happens, transactions continue anyway, in the hope that everything will turn out all 
right. Then a transaction wants to commit, the database checks whether anything bad happened (i.e., whether isolation 
was violated); if so, the transaction is aborted and has to be retried. Only transactions that executed serializably 
are allowed to commit.

As the name suggests, SSI is based on snapshot isolation—that is, all reads within a transaction are made from a 
consistent snapshot of the database. On top of snapshot isolation, SSI adds an algorithm for detecting serialization 
conflicts among writes and determining which transactions to abort.
