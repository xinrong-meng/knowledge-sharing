# Vector Databases

## What

A specialized database that stores and queries vector embeddings for fast similarity search.

## History

Vector databases existed before AI chat apps (they're ~10+ years old):
  - Recommendation systems: Netflix, Amazon product recommendations
  - Image search: Google Images, Pinterest visual search
  - Audio/music: Spotify's "Discover Weekly" (find similar songs)
  - Anomaly detection: Fraud detection, network security

The recent popularity is because RAG needs them, now every developer building a RAG app needs to understand vector databases, whereas before it was mainly ML engineers working on recommendation systems.

## How It Works

```
1. Store: Document → Embed → Vector + Metadata → Vector DB
2. Query: Question → Embed → Find similar vectors → Return top-K documents
```

**Embedding:** Converting text to numbers (vector). An embedding model (neural network) learns to represent meaning as a list of numbers. Similar meanings → similar vectors.

**Similarity:** Cosine similarity (most common), measures angle between vectors. Think of each vector as an arrow pointing in a direction, cosine similarity measures how aligned the arrows are.

## Vector Database Products

- **Chroma** - Python-first, simple local dev
- **Pinecone** - Managed, production-ready
- **Weaviate** - Open source, flexible
- **pgvector** - PostgreSQL extension

## Basic Operations

```python
# Insert
vector_db.insert(id="doc_1", vector=embedding, metadata={"text": "..."})

# Query
results = vector_db.query(query_vector=embedding, top_k=5)

# Delete
vector_db.delete(id="doc_1")
```

## Use Cases

- RAG systems: Chatbots that answer questions using your documentation/knowledge base
- Semantic search: "Find articles about machine learning" finds relevant content even without exact keywords
- Recommendation systems: "Users who liked X also liked Y" based on similarity
- Deduplication: Find near-duplicate content across documents
- Image/audio search: Find similar images or audio clips by embedding
- Anomaly detection: Find unusual patterns by comparing to similar vectors
