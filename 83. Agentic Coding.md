# Agentic Coding

Agentic coding represents a fundamental shift in how developers work with AI. Unlike traditional code assistants that
provide suggestions or completions, agentic coding tools can independently plan, execute, and iterate on complex
development tasks with minimal human supervision.

- Traditional AI coding: You type, AI suggests, you accept/reject
- Agentic coding: You describe a goal, AI autonomously completes the entire task

## What Makes It "Agentic"

- Independent execution
- Self-correction
- Tool usage
- Context awareness: Understands entire codebases, not just individual files
- Goal-oriented: Works toward high-level objectives rather than responding to prompts

### Real-World Example

- Traditional approach
You: "How do I add user authentication?"
AI: "Here's a code snippet for login validation..."
You: Copy, paste, modify, test, debug, repeat...

- Agentic approach
You: "Add user authentication to this web app"
AI: reads existing code -> plans architecture -> implements auth system -> writes tests -> updates documentation ->
creates pull request
You: Review the completed feature

## Example Agentic Coding Tools
| Tool | Interface | Autonomy | Models | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Claude Code** | CLI only | Medium | Claude only | Terminal lovers, safety-first |
| **Cursor** | Desktop IDE | Medium | Multiple | Quick coding, visual interface |
| **Goose** | CLI + Desktop app | High | Any LLM | Flexibility, multi-agent work |

## Example - Claude Code
Claude Code is a command-line tool that lets you work with Claude directly in your development environment: read
codebase, execute commands, and help with various development tasks.

### Setup and Configuration
CLAUDE.md files: These are special files that Claude automatically reads for context.
Tool* permissions: You can customize which tools Claude is allowed to use automatically
Environment integration: It works with your existing tools like git, GitHub CLI, and bash utilities

### Tools
In the context of Claude Code, a "tool" refers to any action or capability that Claude can use to
interact with your system and codebase.
Tools are what make Claude Code "agentic". Think of tools as Claude's hands and eyes, they're how it can actually do
things rather than just talk about them. Think of it like the difference between asking a friend for coding advice
over text vs. having them sit at your computer and actually help you code. The tools are what let Claude "sit at your
computer" and work directly with your project.

#### Types of Tools
1. File Operations
Edit tool: Lets Claude read and modify files
Create tool: Allows Claude to create new files

2. System Commands
Bash tool: Executes command-line operations like npm run build, git commit, python test.py
Specific command patterns like Bash(git commit:*) for git operations

3. External Integrations
GitHub CLI (gh): For creating pull requests, reading issues, managing repositories
MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools: External services like Puppeteer for browser automation, Sentry for error tracking

4. Custom Tools
Slash commands: Custom prompt templates you create
Bash functions: Your own scripts and utilities

### Core Workflows

#### Types of Workflows
1. Explore, Plan, Code, Commit
Explore Phase:
You: "Read the authentication system files and understand how login works, but don't write any code yet"
Claude: ...

Plan Phase:
You: "Think hard about how to add OAuth2 support to this system"
Claude: ...

Code Phase:
You: "Implement your solution, and verify each piece as you go"
Claude: ...

Commit Phase:
You: "Commit this and create a PR"
Claude: ...

2. Write Tests, Commit; Code, Iterate, Commit (TDD)
Write Tests First:
You: "We're doing test-driven development. Write tests for... Don't implement anything yet."
Claude: ...

Confirm Tests Fail:
You: "Run these tests and confirm they fail. Don't write implementation code."
"All tests fail as expected - the register_user function doesn't exist yet."

Commit Tests:
You: "Perfect. Commit just the tests."
Claude: *commits with message like "Add user registration tests (TDD)"*

Code to Pass Tests:
You: "Now write code to make these tests pass. Don't modify the tests. Keep iterating until all tests pass."
Claude: ...

3. Codebase Q&A (Learning/Onboarding)
Architectural Understanding:
You: "How does the caching layer work in this application?"
Claude: ...

Code Investigation:
You: "Why are we calling sanitizeInput() instead of validateInput() on line 245?"
Claude: *looks at git history, function definitions, usage patterns*
"Looking at the git history, sanitizeInput was introduced in commit abc123..."

Pattern Learning:
You: "How do I add a new API endpoint following the existing patterns?"
Claude: *analyzes existing endpoints*
"Based on the existing endpoints, here's the pattern..."

#### Workflow Selection Guide
- Choose Explore → Plan → Code → Commit when:
Problem is complex or unfamiliar
You need to understand existing code first
Solution isn't obvious upfront

- Choose TDD when:
Requirements are clear
You can write good tests
Code correctness is critical

- Choose Q&A when:
Learning a new codebase
Debugging unfamiliar code
Need to understand "why" not just "how"

### Tips
0. One-Minute Rule
If you're spending more than 1 minute explaining something to Claude, you're probably overcomplicating it. Just:
- Show Claude the specific file/error
- Say what you want in simple terms
- Let Claude ask questions if it needs more info

1. Always tell Claude your plan first
❌ "Add a login form"
✅ "I want to add a login form. First, show me how existing forms work in this codebase, then create a plan, then code it."

2. Be super specific
❌ "Fix this bug"
✅ "Look at the error in server.log line 45, figure out why the database connection is failing, and fix it"

3. Use tab completion for files
Type: "look at src/" then hit TAB
Claude will see all your files and know exactly what to work on

4. Paste screenshots
Claude is amazing with images

## Example - Cursor

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on VS Code that brings agentic coding capabilities directly into your development environment.

### Key Features
- Composer: Multi-file editing with natural language instructions
- Chat: Context-aware conversations about your codebase
- Autocomplete: Intelligent code suggestions based on project context
- Codebase Indexing: AI understands your entire project structure and dependencies
- Multi-Model Support: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, and local models

### Core Workflows

#### Composer Workflow
The Composer is Cursor's flagship feature for agentic coding:

Example: Adding User Authentication
```
You: "Add user authentication to this React app. Create a login form, 
     implement JWT tokens, and protect the dashboard route."

Cursor: 
1. Analyzes existing codebase structure
2. Creates auth context and hooks
3. Implements login/logout components
4. Adds route protection middleware
5. Updates API endpoints for authentication
6. Creates necessary database migrations
```

#### Chat-Based Development
Interactive conversations about your code:

Codebase Exploration:
```
You: "How does the caching system work in this app?"
Cursor: Analyzes cache-related files and explains the Redis implementation, 
        cache invalidation strategies, and performance optimizations.
```

Debugging Assistance:
```
You: "This component is re-rendering too often, help me optimize it"
Cursor: Examines the component, identifies unnecessary re-renders, 
        suggests React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback optimizations.
```

### Best Practices
- Be specific about scope and provide context in prompts
- Use Composer for complex multi-file tasks
- Use Chat for learning and debugging
- Maintain clear project structure for better AI assistance

### When to Use Cursor
Ideal for rapid prototyping, learning new frameworks, complex refactoring, and cross-file feature implementation. Consider alternatives for very large codebases or when requiring extensive custom tooling integration.
